Project - TODOList: 

I have developed the project for TODOList and save the data locally.

I have implemented the TODOList task using kotlin, jetpack compose, coroutines, Room database, flow, livedata, navigation graph, MVVM architecture and added the junit test cases. It's save the data locally in the database and save the data in case of screen rotation.
